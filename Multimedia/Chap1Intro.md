# Contemporary Multimedia
> The development, integration and delivery of any combination of text, graphics, animation sound or video through a digital processing device

# Forms of Multimedia

### Non-interactive
- User is an ***OBSERVER*** of information
- User has **no** control over the flow of the information
- Developer establishes the sequence of the media elements and how they are presented
- Examples:
    - Information kiosks
    - Digital animations

### Interactive
- User is a participant in the flow of information
- Basic Interactivity
    - Includes menu and buttons to access contents
    - Most of the websites are like this
- Adaptive or ***Intellimedia***
    - Adapts the information flow to the interests or needs of the users
    - Like AI to judge what you like
- Immersive
    - Draws the user into an alternate world
    - Like AR or VR

# Vannevar Bush
- Created 2 variations of the Memex
- ![Memex](./imgRes/mtm_c0_memex.jpg)

### Memex I (1954)
> *As We May Think, 1945*
> > A hypothetical machine to make the work of scientists more effective and efficient in "grasping the growing mountain of research"

- Features:
    - Massive storage capacity
    - Multimedia input devices like
        - vocoder
            > *As We May Think, 1945*
            > > speak to it, and the corresponding keys move
        - cyclops camera
            > *As We May Think, 1945*
            > > One can now picture a future investigator in his laboratory, his hands are free, and he is not anchored. As he moves about and observes, he photographs and comments
            - (PS I assume this is a camera tied on the forehead from the sentence)
    - Automatic mathematical calculations and logical reasoning
    - New method to store and access information by associations

### Memex II (1959)
- Extends the original proposals of Memex I by considering new technical developments such as
    - Magnetic tape
    - Transistor
    - Digital computer
- Features
    - Professionally maintained associational database delivered by tape or facsimile
        - Facsimile -> an exact copy, especially of written or printed material
    - Trails are color-coded to reflect age and reinforced by repetitive use
    - Combined with a digital computer, Bush believed the Memex II could learn from experience and even demonstrate a form of judgement

# Alan Turing
- Proposed an abstract machine known as the [Turing Machine](#turing-machine)

### Turing Machine
- A means of defining an "effective procedure"
- It's an imaginary device that has three components
    - An **infinitely long tape** consisting of single row of squares
    - A **read/write head** that moved along tape one square at a time
    - A set of instructions
- Single purpose Turing Machines
    - Carry out a specific set of instructions of "effective procedure"
- Universal Turing Machine (UTM)
    - Accept a description of a single purpose turing machine and imitates it's behavior
    - What is in Alan Turing's mind when he created this UTM
        - If we think of a way to do something, the computer can do it

# Douglas Engelbart
- Proposed practical applications of computers beyond the normal mathematical and sorting functions
- Developed interactivity in the ***NLS*** (oNLineSystem)
    - Mouse
    - Multiple screen areas for text editing
    - Email

# Theodore Nelson
- Coined terms
    - HyperText
        - Interactive text linked to other textual information
    - HyperMedia
        - Extends interactive linking to other media
        - Can sort of think like hypertext, but its images/sounds/videos/animations instead of text
- Initiated Xanadu Project
    - Dynamic, expanding hypertext library available to everyone
    - Supports collaborative editing, tracking changes, crediting and rewarding contributors

# Alan Kay
- Proposed a computer design that supports the ways people perceive, learn and create
- Dynabook
    - Designed as a personal computer
    - Tied to the mind and interests of the computer
    - A **modeless** multimedia computer
        - Users can move between graphics, sound and text seamlessly
- Introduced Graphical User Interface (GUI) as an intuitive interface for the Dynabook

# Steve Jobs
- Founded Apple (1976) with Steve Wozniak
- Macintosh computer
    - Introduced in 1984
    - Graphical desktop and Icons provide user interface
    - First mass produced computer
    - Built in sound support
    - Multimedia computing became the standard for modern computers

# Tim Berners-Lee
- Developed a decetralized information system of ***nodes*** linked together for easy access across a network
    - Nodes
        - Anyform of media
        - Anyone can add nodes
        - no centralized control over servers, documents or links
    
# World Wide Web (WWW)

### Basic Components
- Server Computer
- Client Computer
- Browser Software
- HTML scripting language

### WWW & Multimedia Computing
- Solves cross-platform compatibility problem
- Supports distribution of media beyond the CD-ROM storage
- Allowed instant distribution and inexpensive media creation

# Revolution continues
- Factors influencing the revolution
    - Technical breakthroughs in hardware and software
    - Integration of computers with other devicews
    - Digital merger of different technologies and industries
    - Future development of wireless communications and mobile devices
    - Expansion of creative opportunity
