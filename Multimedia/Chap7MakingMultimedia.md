- [Programming](#programming)

# Programming
- Languages to specify how the media is presented and the user interactions are carried out
- Requires the knowledge of the commands of the language
- Time consuming

# Authoring
- Applications specially designed to integrate and present media elements
- Developers can concentrate on design, interactivity and functionality of the project

### Authoring Applications
- Software designed for creation of multimedia projects
- Aplications that are used to
    - Assemble media elements
    - Synchronize contents
    - Design user interface
    - Provide user interactivity

### Authoring metaphors
- Metaphors:
    - A ***COMPARISON*** of one thing to another to enhance understanding
    - Helps orient developers to how the software:
        - Organizes the media
        - Sequences events
        - Presents the final project
- Common metaphors
    - [Card](#card-metaphor)
    - [Icon](#icon-metaphor)
    - [Timeline](#timeline-metaphor)

### Card Metaphor
- Media organized in **SEQUENTIAL ORDER** on a ***STACK OF CARDS OR SLIDES***
    - Appropriate for static media that is normally experienced in sequence
- Have ***TWO*** layers:
    - **Background** Layer: Contains shared elements
    - **Foreground** Layer: Contains content specific to that card or slide
- Benefits:
    - Saves time: Background content is created only once
    - Consistent: The background layers have little change (or no change)
    - Small file size: Background elements are shared

### Icon Metaphor
- Icons define the media and forms of interactivity
- Placed on a ***FLOWLINE*** to create the application structure
    - Each icon has a dialog box with properties and parameters specified by the developer
    - Flowlines:
        - A graphical representation of the relationships between the components of the application
        - Let developer visualize and adjust the structure of the application (smtg like flowchart)
- Branching routine add control to user interaction

### Timeline Metaphor
- Organizes media and interactivity as sequence of frames
    - Each frame can have different layers
    - Layers define the stacking order of the content to be displayed
- Appropriate for dynamic media as the media can be synchronized precisely over time
- Popular timeline-based applications
    - Director
    - Flash
- Best used when animation or video is the central of the application
